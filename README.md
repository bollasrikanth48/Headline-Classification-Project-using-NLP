# Headline Classification Project

## Overview
This project employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify news article headlines into categories like Business, Science and Technology, Entertainment, and Health. The analysis was performed on a dataset of over 422,937 articles collected from various publishers.

## Objectives
- Classify headlines into meaningful categories using NLP techniques.
- Provide actionable insights for content personalization and advertisement targeting.
- Demonstrate the effectiveness of PySpark for large-scale text data processing.

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: Tokenization, Stop Word Removal, and Regex transformations.
- **Visualization**: Category distribution, word frequency analysis, and word clouds.
- **Modeling**: Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and Naïve Bayes for classification with 92% accuracy.
- **Business Implications**: Insights for personalized content delivery and ad targeting.

## Technologies Used
- Python (PySpark, NLP libraries)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud)
